# Tidal Synths

A bunch of tidalcycles-ready supercollider synths

## Usage

A convenience file ( `loadAll.scd` ) is provided to load all synths at once.

Open supercollider and execute (or add it to your SC startup code)

```
"/path_to/loadAll.scd".load();
```

If you don't want to load all synths, load them individually

```
(
"/path_to/rhodes.scd".load();
"/path_to/bass8.scd".load();
)
```

## Atribution

I am not sure where the synths came from but they are surely not mines. In the future I will be more careful about this.

## Contribution

More tidal-ready synths are very welcome! Send a PR with your synths or ask to be a collaborator.
